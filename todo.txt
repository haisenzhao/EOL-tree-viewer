show all ancestors instead of just the next one up?

center the images

use the new ping service

update description to include scrolling of detail pane(pgup/pgdn or arrows)

try to prevent the scrolling from bubbling up to the eol page

try to catch mouse wheel events to scroll the detail pane

make initial location be the current page's node.  (with only one ancestor shown?)

make the details pane get focus, so it can scroll
