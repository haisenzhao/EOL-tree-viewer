change URLs to paths and get rid of the window.location stuff

fix the path to the current taxon not loading ancestor-siblings

make sure the size is only defined in one place.  preferably by the size of the client container.

fix the tooltip location so at least the top is on screen.  find a way to show detail with a stationary element.

replace the xml api calls with html api calls.  (reduces the number of round-trips to the server by 2/3).
